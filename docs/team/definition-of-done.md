# Definition of Done (DoD)

A task or feature is considered "Done" only when it meets the following criteria:

### 1. Development & Quality Assurance
- **Work is on a short-lived branch:** The branch focuses on a single task or feature.
- **Code Complete:** The code runs locally without errors and follows team standards.
- **Testing:** Any new behavior has at least starter-level tests or documented test plan notes.
- **CI Checks Pass:** The automated GitHub Actions (linting/tests) must be "green".

### 2. Review & Documentation
- **Peer Review:** A Pull Request (PR) is opened early, reviewed by the partner, and approved.
- **Documentation Updated:** New setup steps or API keys are documented in the README, and docs are updated if behavior changes.

### 3. Final Integration
- **Clean Merge:** The code merges into the main branch with no conflicts.
